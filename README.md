# GenVox
GenVox is an end-to-end Python-based neural speech synthesis toolkit that provides both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Vocoder models. GenVox uses [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/) for its neural backend. GenVox coding style is heavily inspired by [Coqui-AI](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS), and the data flow is inspired by [ESPNET](https://github.com/espnet/espnet). The model architecture codes were taken from various places but heavily modified for better readability, quality and optimization. Read [devlog](dev_log.md) for more details regarding the development.  

ü•£ Recipes for training your model from scratch with [WandB](https://wandb.ai/) support for logging.  
‚öí Tools for creating and processing datasets, and data analysis.  
‚è± Codes for optimized audio and text processing, logging, and pipelines for server-specific optimization.  
üî• Designed to add your own custom architectures.  

Supported TTS (Text2Mel):
- Tacotron2 - [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf) - [original repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2)

Supported Vocoders:
- MelGAN - [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06711.pdf)

## üìñ Installation
Clone the [repo](https://github.com/saiakarsh193/GenVox) using any one of the methods
```bash
# recommended method
git clone https://github.com/saiakarsh193/GenVox
git checkout dev

git clone -b dev https://github.com/saiakarsh193/GenVox

git clone -b dev --single-branch https://github.com/saiakarsh193/GenVox

git remote show origin # to check everything is correctly tracked
```

**NOTE**: If running on ADA cluster
```bash
sinteractive -c 8 -g 1 # to prevent out of memory issue
module load u18/cuda/10.2
module load u18/ffmpeg/5.0.1
```

Setting up the environment
```bash
# create environment with python 3.8 (as it is tested and working) and activate it
conda create --name genvox python=3.8
conda activate genvox
# or
conda create --prefix ./genvox python=3.8
conda activate ./genvox

pip install -r requirements.txt # to install the dependencies
```

## üöÄ Training your model
```bash
# to use wandb for logging, you need to login (only once)
wandb login # then type your API key (you can find your API key in your browser at https://wandb.ai/authorize)

# after all the hard work, you can finally run the code
python3 run.py
```
