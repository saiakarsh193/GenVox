**{Akarsh}**:  
[HindiTTS](https://github.com/saiakarsh193/HindiTTS) for dataset creating, annotating and cleaning. 
[Aeneas_Extended](https://github.com/saiakarsh193/Extended-Forced-Aligner/blob/master/extend_aligner.py) for alignment using aeneas.  
[ESPNET](https://github.com/espnet/espnet/tree/master/egs2/TEMPLATE/tts1#5-tts-statistics-collection), [Coqui](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) for format, pipeline and code reference.  
[ReadtheDocs](https://readthedocs.org) for documentation preparation.  
First understand logging, argparse and get a defined `<input, output, log>` format for any code.  
Follow pip standards, docstrings, and tabspaces for coding.  
Define config file format.  
Learn git branching.  
Decide if bash is used or not: I prefer using it because it is very quick, inclined to write both bash and python variants.
